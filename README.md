 PYTHON COURSE – DAY 1

 Introduction to Python & Basics:

---
What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** created by
**Guido van Rossum** in 1991.

 Why Python is Powerful?

* Easy syntax (like English)
* Beginner friendly
* Used in Data Science 
* Used in AI & ML
* Used in Web Development
* Used in Automation

Big companies using Python:

* Google
* Netflix
* Instagram
* NASA

 How Python Works

When you write Python code:

1. You write code in a file (`.py`)
2. Python interpreter reads it
3. It executes line by line

Python is **interpreted**, not compiled like C/C++.

---

 First Python Program

Every programming journey starts with:

```
print("Hello World")
```

 What happens here?

* `print()` → function
* `"Hello World"` → string
* Output → displayed on screen

---

Variables (Very Important Concept)

What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data.

Example:

```
name = "Gayatri"
age = 20
```

Here:

* `name` stores text
* `age` stores number

Python automatically understands data type.
No need to declare like other languages.

---

 Data Types (Core Foundation)

Python has many data types, but basics are:

---

 1. Integer (int)

Whole numbers
Example:

```
x = 10
```

---

 2. Float (float)

Decimal numbers
Example:

```
pi = 3.14
```

---

3. String (str)

Text values
Example:

```
city = "Mumbai"
```

---

 4. Boolean (bool)

True or False
Example:

```
is_student = True
```

---

Taking Input from User

```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

⚠ Important:
Input always comes as **string**.
If you want number:

```
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
```

---

 Type Checking

You can check data type:

```
x = 10
print(type(x))
```

 Basic Operators

 Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| *        | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |
| **       | Power          |
